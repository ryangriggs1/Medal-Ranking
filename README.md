# Medal-Ranking
This was a program created in Visual Studio using windows forms.
The purpose of this program is to read in a .txt document and decide the winner of the Olympic Games.
My program does this in two ways.
1. By count. The program tallies up all the medals (gold, silver, and bronze) and whoever has the highest total medals wins
2. By color. The program compares the medals and the country with the higest medals wins. If there is a tie in gold medals, then the silver medals will be counted next. If there is still a tie, then the bronze medals will be counted next.

The program produces two outputs. First, the winning countries flag (chosen by count) is shown in the picture box on the form. Second, it will write in the console the winner by both color and count as well as the scores that were read in from the .txt file.
